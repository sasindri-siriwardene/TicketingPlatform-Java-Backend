# 🎫 Ticketing System

## Introduction
The Ticketing System is a Java-based application that simulates a ticket vending and purchasing system using WebSockets. Vendors release tickets at a specified rate, and consumers purchase tickets at a specified rate. The system uses Spring Boot for the backend and can be tested using Postman or any WebSocket client.

### 💻  Explanation of UI Controls

#### WebSocket Endpoint:  
- Connect to the WebSocket endpoint using a client like Postman.

URL: ws://localhost:8080/gettickets

#### Messages:  
- Send a message to get the current ticket status:
```sh
/gettickets
```
- Send a message to close the connection:
```sh
close
```
### 🧪 Postman Configuration:

- Open Postman and create a new WebSocket request.
- Enter the WebSocket URL and connect.
